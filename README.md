### Project Overview

The Jammming project is a React web application that allows users to search the Spotify library, create custom playlists, and save them to their Spotify accounts. The purpose of this project is to practice building a web app using React components, passing state, and making requests with the Spotify API.

### Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

### Features

- Users can search for songs by song title.
    - The application can also include functionality to search by other attributes like artist's name, genre, etc.
- Users can see information about each song such as title, artist, and album for the songs they queried.
    - The design of the information displayed can be customized.
- Users can export their custom playlists to their personal Spotify accounts.

### Future Work

- Implement user authentication to allow users to log in with their Spotify accounts.
- Improve the user interface and design of the web application.
- Add additional features such as creating and managing multiple playlists, adding song recommendations, etc.
